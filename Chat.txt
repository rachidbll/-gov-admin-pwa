Based on my analysis of the code, here are the functionalities that are not fully activated or are using mock data:


  1. Form Creator (`form-creator.tsx`)


   * Backend Integration: The component sends a POST request to /api/forms/create, but there's no backend code provided to handle this request. The form creation is not
     actually saved anywhere.
   * Preview Functionality: The "Preview" button is present but has no associated logic. It doesn't show a preview of the created form.

  2. OCR Processor (`ocr-processor.tsx`)


   * Mock OCR Results: The OCR processing is simulated with a setTimeout and returns hardcoded mock data. It doesn't use a real OCR library like Tesseract.js, even though the
     code mentions it.
   * "Take Photo" Functionality: The "Take Photo" button is present but has no associated logic to access a device's camera.
   * Data Submission: The "Submit Data" button shows a toast notification but doesn't actually send the extracted data to any backend or service.

  3. QCM Interview (`qcm-interview.tsx`)


   * Mock Questions: The interview questions are hardcoded in the mockQuestions array. They are not fetched from a dynamic source.
   * Media Attachments: The "Take Photo" and "Voice Note" buttons are present, but they don't have any functionality to capture media.
   * Saving and Syncing: The "Save Progress" and "Complete Interview" actions only show toast notifications. The interview data is not saved or synced to Google Sheets.

  4. Google Sheets Sync (`google-sheets-sync.tsx`)


   * Mock Connections: The list of Google Sheets connections is hardcoded. There's no real connection to a Google account.
   * Simulated Syncing: The "Sync Now" functionality is simulated with a setTimeout. It doesn't actually sync any data to Google Sheets.
   * "Open Sheet" and "Settings" Buttons: These buttons have no associated logic.


  5. User Management (`user-management.tsx`)

   * Authentication: The useAuth hook is used, but the implementation of the createUser, getAllUsers, updateUser, and deleteUser functions is not provided. The user
     management is not connected to a real authentication system.


  In summary, the application has a well-defined UI and structure, but the core functionalities are mostly placeholders with mock data and simulated actions. To make the
  application fully functional, the backend logic for form creation, OCR processing, interview management, Google Sheets integration, and user authentication needs to be
  implemented.
